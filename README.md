#### Project Description
- Overview
    - This website was designed to be both an instructional tool and an assessment tool for Computer Science teachers and, more specifically, myself. I wanted to create an online space where students could view code and its output, tinker with and answer questions about code, and have access to external support resources. I also wanted students to be able to get immediate feedback, knowing how hard it is for one teacher to keep up with students' debugging needs, and teachers to be able to have access to <i>all</i> students' work so they could "check-in" with them if necessary. This project was inspired by Prof. Jin Kuwata's "Tinker" learning activity.

- Benefits for Teachers:
    - Could be good summative assessment (test, quiz)
    - Facilitates grading process and distribution of materials (everything online and all in one place)
    - Provides summary of student results

- Benefits for Students:
    - Receive immediate feedback on both multiple-choice and written response (helps students self-assess)
    - Consolidates and provides information about and links to  online resources for programmers
    - Helpful to have code-snippet on the side while taking a Computer Science test
    - Have the time to work through problems and tinker with the code before responding to the questions, which allows students to go at their own pace.
